### **Module: Ratio Overlap**

**BACKGROUND**

It is helpful to calculate the proportion overlap of a species’ range
with other features, for example different land cover classes, protected areas, habitat types, or ecoregions, different types of threats (any user-defined georeferenced polygon). 

**IMPLEMENTATION**

Wallace calculates proportion overlap using the changeRangeR function ratioOverlap. Shapefiles uploaded can be separated by any fields’ categories in a shapefile’s attribute table. 

These analyses require the following data:

Shapefile/raster: With environmental information relevant to the species’ distribution. *NOTE: You must upload all three files (.shp, .shx, .dbf) when using a shapefile.
(optional) either 1) a shapefile of land cover features or 2) a continuousnraster. Must be in same projection as r parameter. If shp is a raster, then the number of cells within each quantile are calculated
SDM: 	
Either raster or shapefile object representing a binary range. You can make the model in wallace, upload the sdm in in the User SDM component or use AOO/EOO for calculations
