### **Module: Change through time**

**BACKGROUND**

For users that have information on past environmental conditions or future scenarios, they can calculate indics in metrics over time and view a line graph and table of those indics.

**IMPLEMENTATION**

Wallace implements the envChange function in changeRangeR.

These analyses require the following data:

SDM: This can be a continuous or thresholded sdm. You can make the model in wallace or upload the sdm in in the User SDM component.

Environmental data: For example, forest cover data, that include in the filename the year of the data.

Threshold value: Enter a value for the environmental data that you want to compare across time within the species' range.
